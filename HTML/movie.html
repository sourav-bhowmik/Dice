        <h1>THE OLD GUARD</h1>

        <h2>Plot</h2>

        <p>
        Andromache "Andy" of Scythia, Booker, Joe, and Nicky are centuries-old warriors with regenerative healing abilities who use their vast experience to help people. Breaking their rule of working for the same people twice, former CIA operative Copley hires them to rescue a group of kidnapped children in South Sudan. During the mission, however, they are ambushed and killed. After healing their wounds and killing their attackers, they realize that Copley set them up and filmed their regeneration.

        Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, U.S. Marine Nile Freeman has her throat slit while taking down a military target, only to recover without a scratch. Upon waking, she shares a disturbing dream with the other immortals, who are then alerted to her existence. Andy tracks down and rescues Freeman before military personnel can move her to Germany where she is due to undergo further testing.

        Copley shows the video of the ambush to pharmaceutical executive Steven Merrick, who sends operatives to capture the team. Andy brings Nile to France, where Nile meets the rest of their team. She is told about the female immortal Quynh, the first of Andy's comrades, who was cast into the sea in an iron maiden, and had been continually drowning ever since. The group also reveals that they are not truly immortal: their ability to heal eventually stops, without warning, which happened to a previous immortal, Lykon.
