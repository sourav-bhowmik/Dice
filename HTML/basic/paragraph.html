            PLOT

            College students Rich Stoker and Halley Smith are rock climbing in a remote forest of West Virginia. When Rich reaches the top, he is suddenly murdered before he can help Halley up. Someone then begins to yank Halley up the cliff, forcing her to cut the rope and falls to the ground. She attempts to escape but gets caught in a line of barbed wire and is pulled back into the woods, screaming.

        Three days later, medical student Chris Flynn drives through the mountains of Greenbrier County on his way to a business meeting. En route when a traffic jam is caused by a chemical spill, he stops at a gas station to ask directions from an elderly man and decides to go down a different route through a dirt road to Bear Mountain. He collides with a stationed SUV whose tires have been punctured. The vehicle belongs to a group of youths on a camping trip: Jessie, Carly, Scott, Evan and Francine; who soon realized that their tire puncture was not an accident after Jessie found a strip of barbed wire tied to a tree. Evan and Francine stay to watch the cars as the others go to find help, but both of them are later murdered by a figure when they stumble into the woods. The others find an isolated cabin and go inside to use the phone, but are horrified to find human body parts in the house and attempt to escape before forcing themselves to hide inside when the occupants return home. Three cannibalistic inbred mountain men: Three Finger, Saw Tooth and One Eye enter the cabin with Francine's corpse, and the hiding group watch as her body is dismembered and eaten.
